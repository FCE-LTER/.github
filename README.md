# Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research Program

The Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) LTER Program is one of 28 sites in the [National Science Foundation]'s(https://www.nsf.gov/) [Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network](https://lternet.edu/). FCE researchers examine how climate change and disturbances interact with shifting management of freshwater resources to determine the dynamics and fate of coastal ecosystem properties, functions and services to people.

The FCE LTER program, based at Florida International University's [Institute of Environment](https://environment.fiu.edu/), is highly multidisciplinary, including scientists, students, educators, and research staff from multiple universities and partner institutions and agencies. We "co-produce" long-term science to reveal the causes and consequences of long-term change in coastal ecosystems while informing adaptive management of coastal ecological resources.

Our research examines long-term dynamics in the coastal Everglades, from sawgrass marshes through mangrove forests into the seagrass meadows of Florida Bay, and the human dimensions of change in South Florida.
